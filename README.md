# Mobile Usage Analysis

This repository contains a detailed analysis of telecom usage data, providing key insights into user behavior, mobile usage patterns, and spending habits across different demographics.

## **Project Overview**

This project uses telecom data to analyze:
- **Age Distribution**: Distribution of users across different age groups.
- **Gender Distribution**: The proportion of users across genders.
- **Primary Use**: The main purpose of mobile phone usage, including categories such as Education, Entertainment, Gaming, etc.
- **Screen Time**: Correlation between daily screen time and other usage parameters.
- **Monthly Recharge Costs**: How different groups spend on their mobile recharges.
- **Data Usage by Location**: Insights into how mobile data consumption varies across cities.

## **Key Insights**

1. **Age Distribution**: The dataset shows that most users fall within the age range of 20-40 years.
2. **Gender Distribution**: The distribution of users by gender may be balanced or skewed depending on the data.
3. **Primary Use of Mobile Phones**: Users engage with their phones for varying purposes, including Education, Entertainment, and Gaming.
4. **Screen Time vs. Primary Use**: Different groups have varying screen time, with Education-focused users likely having higher screen time than Gaming-focused users.
5. **Monthly Recharge Costs**: Recharge spending varies between genders, with some categories spending more than others.
6. **Data Usage by Location**: Cities like **Mumbai** and **Delhi** are likely to have higher data usage compared to other locations.

## **Data Analysis and Visualizations**

The project includes several visualizations that help in understanding the data:
- **Age Distribution**: Visualizes the frequency of users within specific age ranges.
- **Gender Distribution**: A count plot showing the proportion of male, female, and other gender users.
- **Primary Use**: A pie chart representing the percentage of users based on their mobile usage.
- **Screen Time vs. Data Usage**: Scatter plots showing the correlation between screen time and data consumption.
- **Recharge Costs**: Visualizations such as box plots to compare recharge costs by gender or location.

## **Technologies Used**

- **Python**: The main programming language for data analysis.
- **pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis library.
- **matplotlib**: Library for creating static visualizations.
- **seaborn**: Advanced visualization library built on top of matplotlib for easier plotting and more complex charts.
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: For interactive analysis and exploring datasets.
